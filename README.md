# GID-Get-It-Done
GID: Get It Done is a web application intended to be a task manager. It allows users to create an account, and sign in, and it displays the tasks specific to each user. It also allows the user to create, read, delete, and update tasks. It also securely takes user input and stores data in the database, preventing both HTML and SQL injection. While developing GID (https://gidbymau.com/)  I have:
- Implemented a relational database with various many-to-many relationships and various tables. The database is updated dynamically through a PHP Data Object and runs very efficiently with  MySQL.
- Developed a website that stored user information in the session, cookies, post requests, and get requests depending on the sensitivity of the data, hence, avoiding repetitive user input and reducing response time. 
- Generated proper PHP object-oriented code, to store functions implemented in multiple files. First-class functions allowed for better functionality regarding flash messages that were stored in the session.
- Employed a combination of CSS, HTML, and PHP to display the tasks for each user in the rank they were introduced and classified in terms of the dates on which they were due.
